<h2>Whole Genome Sequencing in Psychiatric Disorders</h2>
<p>
The WGSPD Consortium has performed whole genome sequencing in a multi-ethnic cohort of over 13,000 individuals.
The combined cohort aggregates individuals from four individual projects, which include both case/controla and family-based designs.
The combined cohort includes individuals diagnosed with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder as well as control individuals and unaffected family members.
This web site contains the results of a combined CNV analysis across the cohort using Genome STRiP.
<p>
The WGSPD Consortium is comprised of four multisite collaborative U01 projects awarded under NIH Grant PAR-14-241
Unveiling the Genome: Genetic Architecture of Severe Mental Disorders Revealed.
The common goal of these projects is to elucidate the full genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to severe mental disorders
through generation and analysis of whole genome sequencing-based experiments and innovative/novel statistical methods.
